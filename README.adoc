* $aveNUS is a financial planning app for meal planning in NUS.
* It is meant for  students who prefer to use a desktop app for managing their food expenditure
within NUS.
* More importantly, $aveNUS is optimized for those who prefer to
work on a Command Line Interface (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI).
