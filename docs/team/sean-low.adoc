== Overview

$aveNUS is a command line interface (CLI) financial planning application that my team and I designed for
CS2103T (Software Engineering) module in School of Computing, National University of Singapore (NUS).

In this project, we morphed the sample address book application into $aveNUS, an application that allows NUS students
to track their financial spending with regards to food purchases. Additionally, the application provides them with
the best food recommendations within their current budget as well as a savings feature to track their savings.

== Summary of contributions

This section provides a summary of the contributions that I have made to the team project.

=== Major enhancement: Sorting Feature

I have added a sorting feature to $aveNUS which allows users to sort the food items based on some specific criterion.

==== What it does

The sorting feature allows users to sort the list of food based on some criterion. This is done by taking into account
specific fields given from the command line interface, or the preset comparator which the user has created.

For example, if the user wishes to see the list of food items in order of ascending price, the list will be then sorted.
As a result, the cheapest food item will be on the top of the food list, followed by the second cheapest food item. And
finally, the most expensive food item will be on the bottom of the food list.

Not only that, the user can turn autosorting on or off. As a result, when the user adds a new food item, the food list
will be autosorted immediately.

==== Justification

NUS students would want to view food based on certain priority. They do not want to scroll through the entire list
just to find the food that they prioritize.

For example, if they want to view the cheapest food in
the food list, they would want it readily available to them.

==== Highlights

While implementing this feature, I had to implement new commands such as `default`, `sort`, `makesort` `customsort` and
`autosort`. `default` and `sort` forms the backbone of the sorting algorithm, where it sorts food items based on
default or specified criterion respectively.

`makesort`, `customsort` and `autosort` allow users to specifies their criterion to sort the food items. The application
can then store the specified criterion and taken into account these criterion. As a result, the user will be able
to see which food items most accurately match the criterion.

Storage functionality for the user's criterion were also implemented. This means that the criterion are conveniently saved
into their hard disk and persist even after the application is closed and restarted.

In this way, the user benefits from the sorting algorithms which allows users to see the food that best matches the
criterion at the top of the food list.
