== Overview

$aveNUS is a Command Line Interface (CLI) financial planning application that my team and I designed for
CS2103T (Software Engineering) module in School of Computing, National University of Singapore (NUS).

In this project, we morphed the sample address book application into $aveNUS, an application that allows NUS students
to track their financial spending with regards to food purchases. Additionally, the application provides them with
the best food recommendations within their current budget as well as a savings feature to track their savings.

The table below provides a quick summary of the symbols and formatting used in this portfolio.

== Summary of contributions

In this section, I will provide a summary of the contributions I have made to the team project.
These include features which I have implemented as well as other project-related contributions.

=== Major enhancement: Savings Feature

I conceptualised and added the Savings feature and all of its related commands.

==== What it does

It allows users to track their saving habits. Users can transfer money from their $aveNUS wallets into their savings account
using the `save` command. In addition, users can transfer money from their savings account and into their $aveNUS wallets
using the `withdraw` command.

Users can then track their savings and withdrawals made from the Savings History Panel of the application's GUI. The savings of a user
is displayed with a green tag, while the withdrawals are displayed as a negative sum of money, and in a red tag.

==== Justification

In university, students are keen to have savings in their lives even after they graduate. They would like to graduate with at least
a certain amount of money in their savings so that they can either pay for their student loans, or return the amount they borrowed
from their parents to pay off their tuition fees. To do this, they have to start saving from the time they step into university.

With the savings feature encompassed into the expenditure tracking application of $aveNUS, the application
serves as a one-stop application for them to efficiently plan their finances when they are in school. The green tags
for savings added, provides a more encouraging display to motivate users to save more. The red tags for the withdrawals
made by the user is intentionally harsher, to serve as a warning to the users when they make a withdrawal.

==== Highlights

I had to implement new classes such as `ReadOnlySavingsHistory`, `SavingsHistory`, `ReadOnlySavingsAccount`, `SavingsAccount`,
`Savings`, `CurrentSavings` and `SavingsHistoryList`. These classes had to be
implemented across the multiple components within the application architecture to support the Savings
feature, allowing me to better understand the project's architecture.

A persistent storage functionality to keep track of the user's savings and withdrawals, was also implemented in this savings feature.
This allowed me to understand how data can be saved from a user's input into a Jackson file.

I also learnt to write unit and integration tests for automated testing within the Savings feature.

Finally, working on the feature gave me the opportunity to interact more in depth with the application's GUI, so
as to effectively present the savings history data to the user.

=== Other enhancements added: History Retrieval and Restricted Display in Savings History

I assisted my team mate in enhancing his command history feature, allowing users to review the 10 latest
commands that they have typed using the `history` command.

In addition, I conceptualised the restricted viewing of Savings History and added the classes related to the feature.

==== What it does

Users can retrieve the 10 most recently typed commands by using the `history` command.

Users can also request to view only their savings/withdrawals in the Savings History Panel. This is done using the `show` command that I
have implemented.

==== Justification

The history feature allows the user to conveniently refer to the list of commands he/she typed previously without the hassle of scrolling through his past commands
one-by-one using the "UP" or "DOWN" keys. This speeds up input as well, since users can simply copy and paste a command that was typed much earlier.
This is especially useful since this application is a Command-Line application.

On the other hand, the restricted view feature allows users to view only their savings/withdrawals. Thus, this allows them to
track the savings/withdrawals they have made so far and decide if they have been withdrawing too much or saving too little.

==== Highlights

I had to work closely with my other team members to implement the history feature as we worked on implementing different parts
of it.

The restriction of the user's savings history panel display, also involved the change of certain commands that affected other
commands in the application. An example would be `CommandResult` class, which is used by multiple components within the application.
