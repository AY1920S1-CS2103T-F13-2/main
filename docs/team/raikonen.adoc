== Overview

$aveNUS is a command line interface (CLI) financial planning application that my team and I designed for
CS2103T (Software Engineering) module in School of Computing, National University of Singapore (NUS).

In this project, we morphed the sample address book application into $aveNUS, an application that allows NUS students
to track their financial spending with regards to food purchases. Additionally, the application provides them with
the best food recommendations within their current budget as well as a savings feature to track their savings.

My main role was to implement the Wallet-Tracking Feature as well as the Purchase-Tracking Feature. The following sections
illustrate these enhancements in more detail, as well as the relevant documentation I have added to
the user and developer guides in relation to these enhancements.

The table below provides a quick summary of the symbols and formatting used in this portfolio.

== Summary of contributions

This section provides a summary of the contributions that I have made to the team project.

=== Major enhancement: Budget-Tracking Feature

I have implemented a Budget-Tracking feature to $aveNUS.

==== What it does

The Budget-Tracking feature allows users to manage their budget for food expenditure.

Firstly, users are able to set their budget using the `budget` command by specifying their budget amount and budget duration.
Following which, users can use the `buy` command to purchase food items which would deduct the corresponding price amount from the wallet.
Lastly, users are able to use the `topup` command to update the budget amount,
if for example, they got an allowance from their parents and wishes to add that to their food budget

The user is updated with regards to the amount as well as the duration left for their current budget through the graphical user interface(GUI).
Budget-related information is also used in the application's recommendation system to suggest appropriate food items within a user's budget.

==== Justification

Our application's main target audience are NUS students, who often may have a limited budget when it comes to food expenditure.

==== Highlights

While implementing this feature, I had to implement new models such as `Wallet`, `RemainingBudget`, `DaysToExpire`, which serves to store the user's budget-related information in a structured manner.
An additional `Money` class was also added to allow for the changes to budget amount to be made without a loss of precision.
Commands such as `budget`, `topup` have also been implemented to update the aforementioned models.

Storage functionality for the user's budget was also implemented. This means that the user's budget-related information
are conveniently saved into their hard disk and persist even after the application is closed and restarted.

Furthermore, using JavaFX's `Properties` and `Binding` application programming interface (API), a user's budget-related information is accurately and updated on a timely basis on the GUI.

=== Major enhancement: Purchase-Tracking Feature

I have added a Purchase-Tracking feature to $aveNUS.

==== What it does

The Purchase-Tracking feature stores a user's purchase history, thereby allowing users to keep track of the food purchases they have made.

Whenever a user uses the `buy` command to purchase a food item, an entry with the purchased food item and time of purchase is added to the purchase history.
The GUI is then re-rendered to show the most updated purchase history.

Information of a user's purchase history is also used in the application's recommendation system to avoid suggesting food items bought recently to encourage user's to try different types of food.

==== Justification

Users may which to check their purchase history in order to remind themselves of their past food expenditure.
Using this information, users will be able to plan their future food expenditure better.

==== Highlights

While implementing this feature, I had to implement new models such as `Purchase`, `TimeOfPurchase` which serves to store a user's purchase in a structured manner.
The `buy` command have also been implemented to allow users to add purchases.

Storage functionality for the user's purchase history was also implemented.
This means that the user's purchase history is conveniently saved into their hard disk and persist even after the application is closed and restarted.

Furthermore, additional user interface(UI) classes such as `ReadOnlyPurchaseHistory` and `PurchaseHistoryList` ensure that a user's purchase history is accurately and updated on a timely basis on the GUI.

=== Minor Enhancement: Command History Tracking and Retrieval

==== What it does

Stores user's previously entered commands in a `CommandHistory` model, thereby allowing users to use arrow keys to scroll through their command history.

With focus on the Command Line, pressing the Up Arrow will recall the previous command.
Correspondingly, the Down Arrow would recall the next command you typed.

==== Justification

As our application is a predominantly Command-Line application, I realised that this would be an extremely useful feature both to users and developers alike.

As a user, having this feature would allow them to be able to redo a command multiple times without re-entering the entire command again.
For example, if a user wishes buy more than one of the first food item in the displayed list, they would be able to enter `buy 1` once and repeat the command again using the Up Arrow.

As a developer, this feature allows for more convenient debugging as developers would not have to re-enter entire commands in order to test changes.

==== Highlights

`CommandHistory` is implemented as a Singleton class despite decreasing its testability.
This is to prevent additional instantiation since every application should only have one command history.

Also, the list of commands in `CommandHistory` is implemented similar to a queue.
It has a maximum length of 10 and when commands that are added when the list is full, the new command would replace the oldest command in the command history list.
