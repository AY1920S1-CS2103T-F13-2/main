== Introduction

$aveNUS is a desktop financial planning app that allows *NUS students* to *plan their meals according
to the amount of budget they set aside per meal* in NUS. With $aveNUS, you can more effectively manage your expenses,
save your favourite meal options within NUS, edit meal options, and even receive recommendations
for meals that suit your budget.

More importantly, $aveNUS is optimized for those who prefer to
work on a Command Line Interface (CLI) while still having the benefits of a
Graphical User Interface (GUI).

Interested in our app? <<Quick Start>> to get started. Enjoy!

== Quick Start

Welcome to $aveNUS! If you are just starting out, this quick start will help you get $aveNUS up and running on
your computer. It will equip you with the basics you need to know to utilise $aveNUS optimally.

. Type the command in the command box and press kbd:[Enter] to execute it. +
e.g. typing *`help`* and pressing kbd:[Enter] will open the help window.
.  Some example commands you can try:

* First, *add* a food item into the menu by typing `add n/Halal chicken rice p/3.00 d/chicken and rice c/Malay` and
press kbd:[Enter]
* Take a look at the food item panel appearing on the left of the window as shown below Figure 1 above.

=== Navigating $aveNUS

* TODO insert when we complete the user interface.

=== Using Commands

You can use the commands described in <<Features>> by typing them into
the command box and then hitting kbd:[Enter].

You have to provide additional parameters for some commands, and the format of each command
is provided in the command descriptions.

Provided below is a summary of the command format used in the $aveNUS User Guide:

****
`UPPER_CASE` words are the parameters supplied by you.

For example, `info COMMAND`, `COMMAND` is a parameter to find out more information about `COMMAND`.

Items in square brackets are optional.

For example, `budget AMOUNT [DURATION]` has an optional parameter `DURATION`, hence `budget 100 10` or `budget 100`
are both valid commands.

Items with …​ after them can be used multiple times or not at all.
For example, `delete INDEX...` works with commands such as `delete 1`, `delete 1 2` and so on.
****

.  Refer to <<Features>> for details of each command.
