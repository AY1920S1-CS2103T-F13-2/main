== Introduction

$aveNUS is a desktop financial planning app that allows *NUS students* to *plan their meals according
to the amount of budget they set aside per meal* in NUS. With $aveNUS, you can more effectively manage your expenses,
save your favourite meal options within NUS, edit meal options, and even receive recommendations
for meals that suit your budget.

More importantly, $aveNUS is optimized for those who prefer to
work on a Command Line Interface (CLI) while still having the benefits of a
Graphical User Interface (GUI).

Interested in our app? <<Quick Start>> to get started. Enjoy!

== Quick Start

Welcome to $aveNUS! If you are just starting out, this quick start will help you get $aveNUS up and running on
your computer. It will equip you with the basics you need to know to utilise $aveNUS optimally.

[NOTE]
This application is optimized for screen resolution of 1400x900 pixels and higher. Anything lower than that and you
might experienced some bugs.

[NOTE]
You might experience some truncated detail on smaller laptop screens. As such, we would advice you to not to input
really long names, description, etc.

=== Navigating $aveNUS

* TODO insert when we complete the user interface.

=== Using Commands

You can use the commands described in <<Features>> by typing them into
the command box and then hitting kbd:[Enter].

You have to provide additional parameters for some commands, and the format of each command
is provided in the command descriptions.

Provided below is a summary of the command format used in the $aveNUS User Guide:

****
`UPPER_CASE` words are the parameters supplied by you.

For example, `info COMMAND`, `COMMAND` is a parameter to find out more information about `COMMAND`.

Items in square brackets are optional.

For example, `budget AMOUNT [DURATION]` has an optional parameter `DURATION`, hence `budget 100 10` or `budget 100`
are both valid commands.

Items with …​ after them can be used multiple times or not at all.
For example, `delete INDEX...` works with commands such as `delete 1`, `delete 1 2` and so on.
****

.  Refer to <<Features>> for details of each command.

[WARNING]
If you do not see any recommendations, make sure that you have a non-zero budget set using
the `budget` command! See <<Sets budget for a number of days: `budget`>> for more information.

==== Adding likes and dislikes to the recommendation system: `like` or `dislike`

Users can specify their liked and disliked categories, tags and/or locations. The recommendation
system will then be able to generate more accurate recommendations with the user's preferences.

[TIP]
Users can provide multiple categories, tags and/or locations with each command. However, at least one category, tag
or location must be provided with each command.

[NOTE]
Users cannot add what they have already liked into your current dislikes,
and vice versa. The user's likes and dislikes will be also saved into the hard disk
for their convenience.

===== To add likes:

****
*Format*: `like [c/CATEGORY]... [t/TAG]... [l/LOCATION]...` +
