== Introduction

* $aveNUS is a desktop financial planning app that allows *NUS students* to *plan their meals according
to the amount of budget they set aside per meal* in NUS. With $aveNUS, you can more effectively manage your expenses,
save your favourite meal options within NUS, edit meal options, and even receive recommendations
for meals that suit your budget.
* More importantly, $aveNUS is optimized for those who prefer to
work on a Command Line Interface (CLI) while still having the benefits of a
Graphical User Interface (GUI).
* Interested in our app? <<Quick Start>> to get started. Enjoy!
