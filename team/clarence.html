<p>$aveNUS is a command line interface (CLI) financial planning application that my team and I designed for
CS2103T (Software Engineering) module in School of Computing, National University of Singapore (NUS).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In this project, we morphed the sample address book application into $aveNUS, an application that allows NUS students
to track their financial spending with regards to food purchases. Additionally, the application provides them with
the best food recommendations within their current budget as well as a savings feature to track their savings.</p>

<p>This section provides a summary of the contributions that I have made to the team project.</p>

<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="major-enhancement-savings-and-withdrawal-feature"><a class="link" href="#major-enhancement-savings-and-withdrawal-feature">Major enhancement: Savings and Withdrawal Feature</a></h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I have added a savings and withdrawal feature that enables users to keep track of their savings and withdrawals from their savings account.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="what-it-does"><a class="link" href="#what-it-does">What it does</a></h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The savings and withdrawal feature allows users to manage their savings.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Firstly, the user must have money set in their wallet. This can be added by using the "budget" command which specifies their budget amount for a budget duration,
or by calling "topup" to topup the amount of money in the wallet without a budget duration. With this, the user can then add an amount of money
into their savings account by using the "save" command.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Next, if the user has money in his savings account, he/she will be able to use the "withdraw" command to transfer money from the savings account
into his/her wallet.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Lastly, the user can track his/her savings and withdrawal history from the graphical user interface (GUI).
The user can also keep track of his current savings account balance from the GUI.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="justification"><a class="link" href="#justification">Justification</a></h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In university, students are keen to plan for their lives after they graduate. Students would like to graduate with at least
a certain amount of money in their banks so that they can either pay for their student loans, or return the amount they borrowed
from their parents for paying off their school fees. To do this, they have to start saving from the time they stepped into university.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>With the savings and withdrawal feature encompassed into the expenditure tracking application of $aveNUS, the application
serves as a one-stop application for them to plan their finances. Students can not only track their expenditure history,
but also take note of their savings and withdrawals they have made over time conveniently in one application. Thus, they will have a
better understanding of their personal spending and savings behaviour, which can encourage them to take the necessary measures to make changes
in these behaviours to suit their financial goals.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="highlights"><a class="link" href="#highlights">Highlights</a></h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>While implementing this feature, I had to implement new models such as <code>Savings</code>, <code>TimeStamp</code>, which allowed users to keep their savings in a structured manner
and track when the saving or withdrawal occurred respectively. I also implemented the model for <code>SavingsAccount</code>, so that the user can reference their SavingsAccount
and make changes to it accordingly.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Storage functionality was also implemented for the user&#8217;s savings history to conveniently save the user&#8217;s savings history into their hard disk.
This functionality is persistent even when the application is restarted.
Furthermore, additional user interface classes such as <code>ReadOnlySavingsHistory</code> and <code>SavingsHistory</code> ensures that a user&#8217;s savings history is accurately
updated on a timely basis on the GUI.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="minor-enhancement-history-command-retrieval"><a class="link" href="#minor-enhancement-history-command-retrieval">Minor Enhancement: History Command Retrieval</a></h3>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="what-it-does-2"><a class="link" href="#what-it-does-2">What it does</a></h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Retrieves the list of commands previously typed by the user from the users command history.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This allows users to refer to the results display to reference the list of commands they have previously typed.
If the user wishes to view the past commands he/she has entered, they can simply type "history" to see the past commands
being reflected in the results display.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The command alias of "h" is also provided to allow the users to engage the same command with less typing.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="justification-2"><a class="link" href="#justification-2">Justification</a></h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This feature allows the user to conveniently refer to the list of commands he/she typed previously without the hassle of scrolling through his past commands
one by one using the "UP" or "DOWN" arrow. This can speed up input as users can simply copy and paste a command that was typed many commands earlier, increasing
convenience to the user.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This is especially useful since this application is a Command-Line application.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="highlights-2"><a class="link" href="#highlights-2">Highlights</a></h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It references the Singleton class of <code>CommandHistory</code>, which was implemented as a queue, and served to primarily allow users to access previously typed commands
from the command-line.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>However, I enabled the user to reference the full list of commands previous type from the <code>CommandHistory</code>. Now, previously typed commands are observable all at once.
This is an enhancement to the implemented command-line command history feature.</p>

<p>This section shows the additions that I have made to the Savings feature of the Developer Guide.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="savings-feature"><a class="link" href="#savings-feature">Savings feature</a></h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The Savings feature allows users to save a specified amount of money from their wallet into their Savings Account using the <code>save AMOUNT</code> command, where <code>AMOUNT</code> is a user defined amount of money to deposit into the user&#8217;s Savings Account.
The Savings feature also allows the user to withdraw from his savings account either into his wallet or withdraw the money completely from the $aveNUS app.
Using the <code>withdraw AMOUNT</code>, users will be able to transfer their money into their $aveNUS wallets, and using "withdraw out AMOUNT", the user can withdraw the
money completely from the Savings Account and the application.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="classes-for-savings-feature-in-model"><a class="link" href="#classes-for-savings-feature-in-model">Classes for savings feature in Model</a></h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The Savings feature was implemented with a new set of classes introduced to the Model. The <code>SavingsAccount</code> is a singleton class
which contains the methods and  classes related to this feature.
The <code>SavingsAccount</code> object is stored in $aveNUS. It exposes a read-only interface <code>ReadOnlySavings</code> to allow the other components to retrieve
the savings history of the user while maintaining data integrity.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The <code>SavingsAccount</code> contains a unique <code>SavingsHistory</code> which contains a list of the past savings and withdrawals made by the user.
which are represented by <code>Saving</code> and <code>Withdrawal</code> respectively. Both <code>Saving</code> and <code>Withdrawal</code>
implement AccountMoney object, which consists of 2 objects:</p>
</div>
<div class="sidebarblock">
<div class="content">
<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p><code>Amount</code> indicated the value added/withdrew and it is displayed in the UI.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>TimeStamp</code> indicated the date and time the amount of money was added/withdrawn.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Each <code>AccountMoney</code> object is unique because the <code>TimeStamp</code> will never be the same. Since it is not possible for the user to do a saving
and a withdrawal at a single time.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>The user may want to add a new saving to his savings account. This can be done with the <code>save</code> command.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The savings/withdrawals are stored in the SavingsAccount in the SavingsHistory object, which stores the savings/withdrawal
as a list.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The current implementation for adding a new saving/withdrawal is done by overwriting the existing SavingsHistory, with a new
SavingsHistory that includes past and new savings/withdrawals.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The command is read as a text string from the command box in the UI and then is executed by calling MainWindow#executeCommand(),
which passes this string (named commandText) to the Logic component by calling Logic#execute(Model model).</p>
