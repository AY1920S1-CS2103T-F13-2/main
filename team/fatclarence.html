<p>$aveNUS is a command line interface (CLI) financial planning application that my team and I designed for
CS2103T (Software Engineering) module in School of Computing, National University of Singapore (NUS).</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>In this project, we morphed the sample address book application into $aveNUS, an application that allows NUS students
to track their financial spending with regards to food purchases. Additionally, the application provides them with
the best food recommendations within their current budget as well as a savings feature to track their savings.</p>

<h3 id="major-enhancement-savings-and-withdrawal-feature"><a class="link" href="#major-enhancement-savings-and-withdrawal-feature">Major enhancement: Savings and Withdrawal Feature</a></h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I have added a savings and withdrawal feature that enables users to keep track of their savings and withdrawals from their savings account.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="what-it-does"><a class="link" href="#what-it-does">What it does</a></h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The savings and withdrawal feature allows users to manage their savings.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Firstly, the user must have money set in their wallet. This can be added by using the "budget" command which specifies their budget amount for a budget duration,
or by calling "topup" to topup the amount of money in the wallet without a budget duration. With this, the user can then add an amount of money
into their savings account by using the "save" command.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Next, if the user has money in his savings account, he/she will be able to use the "withdraw" command to transfer money from the savings account
into his/her wallet.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Lastly, the user can track his/her savings and withdrawal history from the graphical user interface (GUI).
The user can also keep track of his current savings account balance from the GUI.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="justification"><a class="link" href="#justification">Justification</a></h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In university, students are keen to plan for their lives after they graduate. Students would like to graduate with at least
a certain amount of money in their banks so that they can either pay for their student loans, or return the amount they borrowed
from their parents for paying off their school fees. To do this, they have to start saving from the time they stepped into university.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>With the savings and withdrawal feature encompassed into the expenditure tracking application of $aveNUS, the application
serves as a one-stop application for them to plan their finances. Students can not only track their expenditure history,
but also take note of their savings and withdrawals they have made over time conveniently in one application. Thus, they will have a
better understanding of their personal spending and savings behaviour, which can encourage them to take the necessary measures to make changes
in these behaviours to suit their financial goals.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="highlights"><a class="link" href="#highlights">Highlights</a></h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>While implementing this feature, I had to implement new models such as <code>Savings</code>, <code>TimeStamp</code>, which allowed users to keep their savings in a structured manner
and track when the saving or withdrawal occurred respectively. I also implemented the model for <code>SavingsAccount</code>, so that the user can reference their SavingsAccount
and make changes to it accordingly.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Storage functionality was also implemented for the user&#8217;s savings history to conveniently save the user&#8217;s savings history into their hard disk.
This functionality is persistent even when the application is restarted.
Furthermore, additional user interface classes such as <code>ReadOnlySavingsHistory</code> and <code>SavingsHistory</code> ensures that a user&#8217;s savings history is accurately
updated on a timely basis on the GUI.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="minor-enhancement-history-command-retrieval"><a class="link" href="#minor-enhancement-history-command-retrieval">Minor Enhancement: History Command Retrieval</a></h3>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="what-it-does-2"><a class="link" href="#what-it-does-2">What it does</a></h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Retrieves the list of commands previously typed by the user from the users command history.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This allows users to refer to the results display to reference the list of commands they have previously typed.
If the user wishes to view the past commands he/she has entered, they can simply type "history" to see the past commands
being reflected in the results display.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The command alias of "h" is also provided to allow the users to engage the same command with less typing.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="justification-2"><a class="link" href="#justification-2">Justification</a></h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This feature allows the user to conveniently refer to the list of commands he/she typed previously without the hassle of scrolling through his past commands
one by one using the "UP" or "DOWN" arrow. This can speed up input as users can simply copy and paste a command that was typed many commands earlier, increasing
convenience to the user.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This is especially useful since this application is a Command-Line application.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="highlights-2"><a class="link" href="#highlights-2">Highlights</a></h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It references the Singleton class of <code>CommandHistory</code>, which was implemented as a queue, and served to primarily allow users to access previously typed commands
from the command-line.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>However, I enabled the user to reference the full list of commands previous type from the <code>CommandHistory</code>. Now, previously typed commands are observable all at once.
This is an enhancement to the implemented command-line command history feature.</p>

<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This section shows the additions that I have made to the Savings feature of the Developer Guide.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="savings-feature"><a class="link" href="#savings-feature">Savings feature</a></h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The Savings feature encompasses a Savings Account feature and a Savings History feature, both of which work together to allow the user
to track his/her savings effectively.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The Savings Account feature allows users to save a specified amount of money from their wallet into their savings account using the <code>save AMOUNT</code> command, where <code>AMOUNT</code> is a user defined amount of money to deposit into the user&#8217;s savings account.
The feature also allows the user to withdraw money from his/her savings account, direcly into his/her $aveNUS wallet. This is accomplished using the <code>withdraw AMOUNT</code> command.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Meanwhile, the Savings History feature is also introduced to allow $aveNUS users to keep track of all their savings and withdrawals.
This is available by clicking the "Savings" tab located below the Savings Account and Wallet display.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Also, users can choose to view their savings or withdrawals only, by calling the <code>show TO_DISPLAY</code> command. This allows the user to have a quick overview of his savings/withdrawals history to decide
if he/she has been saving enough or not. <code>TO_DISPLAY</code> must either be <code>savings</code>/
<code>withdrawals</code>/<code>both</code>, whereby the <code>TO_DISPLAY</code> input is case-insensitive, i.e. <code>show SaVinGs</code> and <code>show savings</code> are valid inputs.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="classes-for-savings-account-feature-in-model"><a class="link" href="#classes-for-savings-account-feature-in-model">Classes for Savings Account feature in Model</a></h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The Savings Account feature was implemented with the introduction of a new set of classes into the Model. A new <code>SavingsAccount</code> class encapsulates all the methods and classes
related to this feature. The <code>SavingsAccount</code> object is stored in $aveNUS and it exposes only a read-only interface, <code>ReadOnlySavingsAccount</code>, to allow other components to retrieve
the retrieve information within the user&#8217;s <code>SavingsAccount</code>, while maintaining data integrity.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><code>SavingsAccount</code> contains a single instance of the <code>CurrentSavings</code> class, a class we implemented to allow greater abstraction of the user&#8217;s current savings value.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><code>CurrentSavings</code> is only called once throughout the application and is modified with package-protected methods within the class itself.
This allows the <code>CurrentSavings</code> itself to be unmodifiable in other components in the application except within the <code>SavingsAccount</code> itself.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Within <code>CurrentSavings</code>, there is an unmodifiable <code>Money</code> class. Once a <code>CurrentSavings</code> object is created with a fixed value, it cannot be changed.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The <code>SavingsAccount</code> Class Diagram below shows the relationship between the classes mentioned above.</p>
</div>
<div class="imageblock" style="text-align: center">

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Also, the Savings History feature was implemented with another set of classes introduced to the Model. It includes a new <code>SavingsHistory</code> class, which contains all the methods
related to this feature. The <code>SavingHistory</code> object exposes only a read-only interface, <code>ReadOnlySavingsHistory</code>, to allow other components within the application to retrieve the savings
history of the user.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Within the <code>SavingsHistory</code> object, it contains all the methods to interact with the <code>SavingsHistoryList</code> object. Hence,
Each <code>SavingsHistory</code> object only has ONE unmodifiable <code>SavingsHistoryList</code> object.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The <code>SavingsHistoryList</code> class acts as an abstraction of a list, which sole purpose is to store all <code>Savings</code> made by the user.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Withdrawals and savings made by the user are both objects of the class <code>Savings</code>. Within the <code>Savings</code> class, there are 3 unmodifiable attributes:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><code>Money</code> which is a class that contains the value of the <code>Savings</code> made. It is a negative value if a withdrawal is made, and a positive
value if a saving was made.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>TimeStamp</code> which is a class that contains the time in which the <code>Savings</code> object was created, i.e. what time the saving/withdrawal was
made by the user.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>isWithdraw</code> which is a boolean that is <code>true</code> if the <code>Savings</code> object is a withdrawal, and false if the object is a saving.</p>

<h3 id="savings-feature-2"><a class="link" href="#savings-feature-2">Savings feature</a></h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The Savings feature encompasses a Savings Account feature and a Savings History feature, both of which work together to allow the user
to track his/her savings effectively.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The Savings Account feature allows users to save a specified amount of money from their wallet into their savings account using the <code>save AMOUNT</code> command, where <code>AMOUNT</code> is a user defined amount of money to deposit into the user&#8217;s savings account.
The feature also allows the user to withdraw money from his/her savings account, direcly into his/her $aveNUS wallet. This is accomplished using the <code>withdraw AMOUNT</code> command.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Meanwhile, the Savings History feature is also introduced to allow $aveNUS users to keep track of all their savings and withdrawals.
This is available by clicking the "Savings" tab located below the Savings Account and Wallet display.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Also, users can choose to view their savings or withdrawals only, by calling the <code>show TO_DISPLAY</code> command. This allows the user to have a quick overview of his savings/withdrawals history to decide
if he/she has been saving enough or not. <code>TO_DISPLAY</code> must either be <code>savings</code>/
<code>withdrawals</code>/<code>both</code>, whereby the <code>TO_DISPLAY</code> input is case-insensitive, i.e. <code>show SaVinGs</code> and <code>show savings</code> are valid inputs.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="classes-for-savings-account-feature-in-model-2"><a class="link" href="#classes-for-savings-account-feature-in-model-2">Classes for Savings Account feature in Model</a></h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The Savings Account feature was implemented with the introduction of a new set of classes into the Model. A new <code>SavingsAccount</code> class encapsulates all the methods and classes
related to this feature. The <code>SavingsAccount</code> object is stored in $aveNUS and it exposes only a read-only interface, <code>ReadOnlySavingsAccount</code>, to allow other components to retrieve
the retrieve information within the user&#8217;s <code>SavingsAccount</code>, while maintaining data integrity.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><code>SavingsAccount</code> contains a single instance of the <code>CurrentSavings</code> class, a class we implemented to allow greater abstraction of the user&#8217;s current savings value.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><code>CurrentSavings</code> is only called once throughout the application and is modified with package-protected methods within the class itself.
This allows the <code>CurrentSavings</code> itself to be unmodifiable in other components in the application except within the <code>SavingsAccount</code> itself.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Within <code>CurrentSavings</code>, there is an unmodifiable <code>Money</code> class. Once a <code>CurrentSavings</code> object is created with a fixed value, it cannot be changed.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The <code>SavingsAccount</code> Class Diagram below shows the relationship between the classes mentioned above.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Also, the Savings History feature was implemented with another set of classes introduced to the Model. It includes a new <code>SavingsHistory</code> class, which contains all the methods
related to this feature. The <code>SavingHistory</code> object exposes only a read-only interface, <code>ReadOnlySavingsHistory</code>, to allow other components within the application to retrieve the savings
history of the user.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Within the <code>SavingsHistory</code> object, it contains all the methods to interact with the <code>SavingsHistoryList</code> object. Hence,
Each <code>SavingsHistory</code> object only has ONE unmodifiable <code>SavingsHistoryList</code> object.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The <code>SavingsHistoryList</code> class acts as an abstraction of a list, which sole purpose is to store all <code>Savings</code> made by the user.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Withdrawals and savings made by the user are both objects of the class <code>Savings</code>. Within the <code>Savings</code> class, there are 3 unmodifiable attributes:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><code>Money</code> which is a class that contains the value of the <code>Savings</code> made. It is a negative value if a withdrawal is made, and a positive
value if a saving was made.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>TimeStamp</code> which is a class that contains the time in which the <code>Savings</code> object was created, i.e. what time the saving/withdrawal was
made by the user.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>isWithdraw</code> which is a boolean that is <code>true</code> if the <code>Savings</code> object is a withdrawal, and false if the object is a saving.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>A <code>Savings</code> object is instantiated in the <code>WithdrawCommand</code> with the user&#8217;s input. Because a withdrawal is subtracted from the savings account, the withdrawal is a <code>Savings</code> object
recorded with a negative value.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It contains information about how much <code>Money</code> was withdrawn, and the <code>TimeStamp</code> of the withdrawal made. The <code>Money</code> object contains the amount to withdraw, and the <code>TimeStamp</code>
object contains the time and date the withdrawal was made by the user.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When <code>WithdrawCommand#execute()</code> is called, <code>model#withdrawFromSavings(savings)</code> is called. Within the <code>Model</code> of $aveNUS, the user&#8217;s
savings account is checked. If the user attempts to withdraw more money than he/she has in the savings account, they will be prompted that the command
is invalid.</p>

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Only when this check is passed, the savings amount is added into the user&#8217;s wallet, using the command <code>wallet#setRemainingBudget(newRemainingBudget)</code>.

<div class="ulist">
<ul>

<p>Maintains better abstraction since <code>Savings</code> and <code>Withdrawals</code> should implement similar methods and have similar attributes. They
are simply opposites of each other.</p>

<li>
<p>Implementation of the <code>SavingsHistory</code> and <code>SavingsHistoryList</code> becomes complicated since both <code>Savings</code> and <code>Wtihdrawals</code>

</li>
<li>
<p>Converting the user&#8217;s savings history from the the Jackson File to a <code>SavingsHistory</code> object would be more complicated,
because through this implementation, we were trying to maintain a non-negative money object, but the withdrawal is saved with a
negative value.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To read back the withdrawal from the Jackson file (savings.json) for savings account, an additional boolean might have to be saved persistently into the user&#8217;s hard disk
to differentiate savings from withdrawals. This is necessary since the value saved will always be positive in this implementation.</p>
</li>

<p>Implementation of <code>JsonAdaptedWithdrawals</code> and <code>JsonAdaptedSavingsItem</code> would be required,

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Upon the request of the user to display only the savings he/she makes using, for example, <code>show savings</code>, a

a <code>CommandResult</code> which is instantiated with two booleans: <code>showSavingsOnly</code> and <code>showWithdrawalsOnly</code>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Within the <code>MainWindow</code> class of the application, these booleans are checked upon the calling of <code>mainWindow#executeCommand(commandText)</code>.

<div class="paragraph">
<p>This leads to the call to <code>ReadOnlySavingsHistory#getSavingsOnly()</code> method within the <code>ReadOnlySavingsHistory</code> class. This call

<p>Finally, the savings history panel in the <code>MainWindow</code> class is updated with this unmodifiable list. The result
